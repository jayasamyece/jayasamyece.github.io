            CyberPatriot, initiated by the Air & Space Forces Association, is the National Youth Cyber Education Program with the mission of inspiring K-12 students to pursue careers in cybersecurity and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields critical to our nation's future. At its core, the program features the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition, the largest cyber defense competition in the nation, empowering high school and middle school students to take charge of securing virtual networks. Additional components encompass AFA CyberCamps, the CyberPatriot Alumni Network, an elementary school cyber education initiative, a children's literature series, CyberGenerations – an initiative focused on senior citizen cyber safety, and a Tech Caregivers program, encouraging cyber-savvy volunteers to contribute to their communities.

            As a Cadet with a strong STEM passion, I wholeheartedly engage in the RVCS Cyber Patriot Team Competitions. CyberPatriot immerses teams of middle and high school students into the roles of IT professionals responsible for managing a company's network. Through these competitions and training experiences, I've acquired foundational cyber defense skills, honed problem-solving abilities, delved into the history of the cyber domain, and explored ciphers and encryptions.

            During these competitions, my team and I are tasked with the mission of identifying cybersecurity vulnerabilities within virtual image operating systems. We relish the challenge of fortifying the system's defenses while ensuring the continuity of critical services, all within the span of a rigorous six-hour period.
